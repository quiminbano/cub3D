# Cub3D

## Introduction

**Cub3D** is a raycasting-based game engine built as a part of the 42 school curriculum. The goal of the project is to create a first-person 3D rendering environment, similar to old-school games like *Wolfenstein 3D*. Using 2D maps, the program renders a 3D view using raycasting to simulate depth, walls, and textures. This project is good to understand mathematical concepts, such as vectors and trigonometry, and the application of them to develop a videogame.

## What are the features I can find in cub3D?

- First-person 3D perspective using raycasting
- Render textured walls based on a 2D map
- Player movement (WASD) and camera rotation (left/right arrows)
- Collision detection with walls
- Configurable maps with textures, floor, and ceiling colors

## What do I need to try cub3D?

- A Unix-based system (Linux or macOS)
- A C compiler (gcc or clang)
- Basic knowledge of fractals and complex numbers

This repository already includes a version of Minilibx to work in macOS. However, if you want to try this project in linux, you can click [here](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git). You have to name the folder minilibx_linux to make it work. Keep in mind that the project was developed in macOS, using the macOS version of minilibx. It can be some compatibility errors trying to build the project in linux.
